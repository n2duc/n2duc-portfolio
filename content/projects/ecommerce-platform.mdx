## Project Overview

Built a full-featured e-commerce platform for a growing retail brand, focusing on performance, accessibility, and conversion optimization. The platform handles thousands of transactions monthly and provides a seamless shopping experience across all devices.

## Challenge

The client's existing platform was slow, outdated, and had a poor mobile experience. Cart abandonment rates were high (72%), and the site struggled with Core Web Vitals, resulting in lower search rankings.

### Key Issues:
- Poor Lighthouse scores (45 Performance, 68 Accessibility)
- Slow page load times (5.2s LCP)
- High cart abandonment rate (72%)
- Non-responsive design
- Complex checkout flow

## Solution

Rebuilt the platform from scratch using modern technologies and performance-first architecture.

### Technical Approach

**Performance Optimization:**
- Implemented Next.js App Router for optimal code splitting
- Used Server Components to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Optimized images with next/image (AVIF/WebP)
- Implemented smart prefetching for product pages
- CDN caching strategy for static assets

**User Experience:**
- Simplified checkout flow from 5 steps to 3
- Added guest checkout option
- Implemented real-time inventory updates
- Progressive image loading with blur placeholders
- Skeleton screens for better perceived performance

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Screen reader optimization
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for modals and drawdowns

## Results

The new platform exceeded all expectations:

<Callout type="success">
- **+120% conversion rate** (from 2.1% to 4.6%)
- **-38% cart abandonment** (from 72% to 44%)
- **98 Lighthouse score** (up from 45)
- **1.2s LCP** (down from 5.2s)
- **+156% mobile traffic** due to better mobile experience
</Callout>

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Lighthouse Performance | 45 | 98 | +118% |
| LCP | 5.2s | 1.2s | -77% |
| FID | 280ms | 45ms | -84% |
