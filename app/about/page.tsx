              <p>
                Hi! I&apos;m <span className="text-accent font-semibold">{siteConfig.name}</span>,
                a passionate website developer based in {siteConfig.location}. I specialize in
                building fast, accessible, and delightful web experiences that make a difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                With over 5 years of experience in web development, I&apos;ve had the privilege
                of working with startups and established companies to bring their digital visions
                to life. My approach combines technical excellence with a deep understanding of
                user needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                I&apos;m particularly passionate about performance optimization, accessibility,
                and creating seamless user experiences. When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find
                me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or sharing knowledge
                with the developer community.
